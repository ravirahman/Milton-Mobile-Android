# Milton Mobile Android

_Note: for the latest code, please see the [team repository](https://github.com/milton-programming/MiltonMobileAndroid)._

This app, developed by the 2014-15 Programming Applications class at Milton Academy,
allows members of the school community to see
dining information, activity listings, and mailbox combinations.

My responsibilities included:
- Designing the overall layout
- Building the student activities section
- Configured login-logout functionality
- Implementing caching for the mailbox section
- Optimizing the network requests.

We published it on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.milton.miltonmobileandroid)
and also developed and released an [iOS Version](https://github.com/milton-programming/Milton-Mobile-iOS).
